This is a number of tools to collect DNS data for DNSSEC analysis.

cleanzone.pl   cleans a (signed) zone and extracts all domains (lnames) with DS records  
collect.pl     collects all DNSSEC related data for later analysis (outputs JSON)  
analyze.pl     for analysis of the JSON files with DNS info  

----

Example usage, batch for a lot of domains:

# create a list from a signed zone file
cleanzone.pl -f zonefile > domainlist.txt
# run 
collect.pl -f domainlist.txt -d directory
# do some analysis
analyze.pl -d directory --rcode     # analyze return codes
analyze.pl -d directory --servfail  # toplist of name servers with SERVFAIL

Or just get data from a domain:

collect.pl --pretty -n iis.se
